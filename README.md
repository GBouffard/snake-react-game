## How to run locally:

- General Use:

cd snake-react-game

npm install
npm start

## Methodology:

- I wanted to learn and experiment with canvas and games so found examples of snake games and tutorials (JS/HTML/JQuery) which I studied in order to make my own version mostly based on React and JavaScript.
- The app was scaffolded through react-create-app.
- I then build in a scalable way the game. In order I added an empyty Canvas, a target, a snake, and motions as well as handling different cases that make the game what it is.
- This game being available on mobile phones from the late 90s/early 2000s I wanted to create a cool retro UI which I then worked on.
- I added responsive design and animations.
- I added a tooltip component to explain how to play the game on different devices.
- I deployed using Github pages.
- I then added a little score tracker because in the end, it's nice to know how well we do in this game.

## What I learnt:

- Canvas and how to make a game on canvas
- Is-touch-device
